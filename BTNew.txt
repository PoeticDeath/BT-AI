Some common misconceptions about Artificial Intelligence and how it works:

One of the the most common misconceptions about Artificial Intelligence is its ability to replace a human. As much as our technology has evolved and been improved, the way we interact with it does not allow for most of the basic requirements needed to accomplish certain tasks. We interact with A.I. on a input and output basis. Meaning that A.I. can not come up with things to do all on its own.
Another common misconception is that all Artificial Intelligences have the same capabilities but there are many different types of A.I. Some being text generation, visual generation and interpretation, or audio generation and interpretation. Due to Artificial Intelligence's inability to come with anything on its own text generation naturally includes text interpretation whereas the rest are separate in most instances. Some programs or implementations incorporate multiple types however these are less common.
The next misconception being that Artificial Intelligence needs a supercomputer to be run. In reality most modern hardware is capable of running the software necessary to create or run an A.I. In fact one of your devices is likely doing so... Siri is an A.I. and it runs on all recent Apple Devices. The following paragraph was written by an text generation A.I. trained on the all Corry Beaver Tales articles as of 12/16/22. Then given this article as an input to complete.
